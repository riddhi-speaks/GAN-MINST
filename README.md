# GAN-MINST
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The goal of this project is to generate realistic hand-written digit images using deep learning techniques.
  This code implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset. The Discriminator network aims to distinguish between real MNIST images and images produced by the Generator. The Generator, on the other hand, tries to create images that can fool the Discriminator into thinking they are real. Through this adversarial training, the Generator learns to produce increasingly realistic handwritten digits. While not directly applicable for real-time use, this project serves as a fundamental example of using GANs for image generation, which has applications in various fields like creating artistic data or augmenting existing datasets.
